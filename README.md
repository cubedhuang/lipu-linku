# lipu Linku

New **lipu Linku**, powered by [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

To work with GitHub Pages, this uses [adapter-static](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/adapter-static/README.md).

## Developing

Development requires NodeJS. If you don't have `pnpm` installed, install it with `npm install -g pnpm`.

Install dependencies with `pnpm install`, and start a development server with `pnpm dev`.

## Building

To create the production version of the app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
