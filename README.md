# lipu Linku

New **lipu Linku**, powered by [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/).

To work with GitHub Pages, this uses [adapter-static](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/blob/master/packages/adapter-static/README.md).

## Developing

Once dependencies are installed with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Building

To create the production version of the app:

```bash
pnpm build
```

You can preview the production build with `pnpm preview`.
